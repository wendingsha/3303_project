Gabriel Song: 
-In iteration2, UML class and sequence diagrams are produced with associated comments and explanations. 
-In iteration3, provide the first version of the master file, and provide a test environment for the overall code, and check if the subsystem can complete the unit test.

Jason Shi:
-In iteration2, the code submitted in the previous iteration was refined to have the requirements needed in this iteration. Paving the way for a multi-threaded elevator. 
-In iteration3, the code continues to be updated so that it can make complete use of multiple elevators and meet the requirements mentioned in this iteration. All the code can be tested with the final version of the unit test.
